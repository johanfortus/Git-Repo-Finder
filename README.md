# Git Repo Finder
Git Repo Finder - Frontend App 

## Summary

Developed as a personal project, RepoFinder was created to practice and demonstrate skills in implementing external APIs effectively.

A dynamic and user-friendly GitHub repository search tool, designed to streamline the process of finding repositories based on user-defined search criteria.

This web application is a showcase of modern web development practices, utilizing HTML, Bootstrap for responsive design, JavaScript, jQuery for efficient DOM manipulation, and Axios for seamless HTTP requests.

The application interfaces with GitHub's REST API to fetch repository data based on user queries. It offers an intuitive interface that allows users to search for GitHub repositories using various filters and keywords.
